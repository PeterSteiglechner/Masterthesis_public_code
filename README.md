# Masterthesis on "Estimating global warming from anthropogenic heat emissions" (2018) at Uni Potsdam

The code mentioned in my Masterthesis is accessible here.

- `CLIMBER` contains code to simulate the anthropogenic heat flux in scenarios with a model of intermediate complexity. 
- `EBMs` contains code to simulate the anthropogenic heat flux in simple 0D or 1D energy balance models.
